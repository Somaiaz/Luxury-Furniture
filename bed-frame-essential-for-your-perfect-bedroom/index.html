If necessary, use a slightly damp cloth for sticky spots, but remember to dry it immediately afterward to avoid moisture damage.</p><h3>2. Protect from Heat and Moisture</h3><p>Always use coasters, placemats, and cloths when placing hot or wet items on the dining table. This will protect the surface from heat damage and water rings.</p><h3>3. Avoid Direct Sunlight</h3><p>Direct sunlight can fade the color of your dining set over time. If possible, place it away from windows or use curtains to limit exposure to sunlight.</p><h3>4. Periodic Maintenance</h3><p>For wooden dining sets, consider applying furniture polish to keep the finish glowing. Check for any loose screws or joints and address them promptly to ensure stability.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Cleopatra dining set is more than just a piece of furniture; it’s a gateway to luxurious dining experiences.
